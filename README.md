## InterDistillery

### Mid-Term for Skill Distillery.

## Overview: mid-term

Build a full stack application working in a group of 3-4 individuals. As a group plan, communicate, pair-program and delegate tasks utilizing git branches to preserve data integrity. Run daily srum meetings, assign DBA, scrum master and git manager roles.  

Assignment Guidelines:

A fully developed database schema. The database must be connected to your Java code using JPA.

Our friend C.R.U.D, this time manipulating objects and saving them in an appropriate database table.

A user log in, which is authenticated by a mySQL table. There should be different permission levels for the users, one admin that can add/update/delete content present on the site.

A correct implementation of a session object, this can be used to track a logged in user and any changes they make (for example, a shopping cart or favorites list).

A way to track an individual user's previous experiences on the site. For example if it is a food ordering system, a list of previous orders.

## Lessons Learned

Nathan - DBA
Angel - Scrum Master
Charli - Git Manager

This project was an excellent learning opportunity. As one of the first full stack application group projects learning to plan, develope and execute as a remote team was great. We came across multiple merge errors and really strengthened our understanding of git and working with git branches to preserve the main branch.

Our team was able to work well together finding a good balance of pair programming and delegating tasks to be completed separately and later merged together into the main project.

This project helped us understand the reality between gran concepts and plans and the time and technologies needed to execute those plans. We were able to develop a minimum viable product with time to focus on design, though we did not reach many of our stretch goals.
